 * A representation of a Priority Queue datastructure that utilises the Huntington-Hill method

 * able to determine the number of seats that should be allocated to that individual state.
 * 
 * This current version of this class does not work with generics as the data model representing 
 * a state is implemented directly inside this class. 
 * 
 * Arguably, refactoring and implementing the class to be able to handle generics would 
 * all around have beeen a better solution. However, due to the nature and scope of this 
 * assignment, we deemed the current implementation as sufficient.
